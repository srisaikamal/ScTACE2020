                established during the academic year 2001-2002 to empower women
                in professional courses. This institute has witnessed
                significant growth within 19 years and stands out as one of the
                best engineering colleges in AP. This institute is accredited by
                NAAC with 'A' grade. This institution is under Autonomous Status
                from the academic year 2014-2015 and it is the first women's
